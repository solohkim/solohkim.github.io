Welcome to this blog post where we are going to explore meow machine from hack the box.
In this room we are going to learn more in web penetration, cross site scripting, and hashing techniques


## SQL INJECTION
SQL injection (SQLi) is a security vulnerability where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to 
manipulate backend databases

## XSS INJECTION
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a, client-side security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious JavaScript or
HTML into trusted websites, which then executes in victims' browsers
